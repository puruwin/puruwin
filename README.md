### Hello there! 👋

I'm David *(aka Puru)*, a full-stack engineer from 🏖 Alicante, Spain. 
I love learning new things and discover new challenges! That's why you will always find me researching new programming languages and training in [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/puruwin).
I've been a JavaScript enthusiast my whole career but I'm transitioning into a more *functional programming* approach on things.
I'm currently working at 🛫 [AirEuropa](https://www.aireuropa.com/es/en/home) as a full-stack engineer.
